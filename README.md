# Operating-system-for-embedded-systems

Such project regards the Operating system for embedded system assignment that I committed during my Master of Science in Mechatronics Engineering. 

I have worked on this project with my collegue Matteo. We have so much fun working on this and also thanks to this project we built a very good relationship having spent day and night on this and other projects. Despite form the fact that we have a mechanical background, we were among the first ones in the class to finish the assignment (It took us just less than one week).

The goal of the project has been to program a simple opearting system (Micrium Î¼C-OS3) and upload it on an NXP evaluation embedded board (NXP S32K144). The board is provided, among others, with two buttons, a potentiometer and one LED. The operating system should provide two simple services:

- Change the LED color with a certain queue through the buttons
- Vary the intensity of the LED playing with the potentiometer

Here I publish the assignment made by my professor Massimo Violante, the folder with the programming solution and the Assignment Report.
