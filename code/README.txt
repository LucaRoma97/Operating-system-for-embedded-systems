# code
I have scanned the datasheet of the NXP S32K144 in order to find the way to use the potentiometer and the buttons for the assigned purpose. I have set the correspondent addresses of the board with the right masks. Then for the service, I made use of simple operanting system tools like semaphore and interrupt handlers.
